# Chapter 5

> “Nobody’ll ever change my mind about it.”

## Part 1

On a Sunday evening in 2015, with Christmas less than a week away, I log into Facebook at home and notice I have an urgent-seeming message from Tyler’s mother, Maya. FYI, she writes, Tyler will probably be in jail Monday. There’s a warrant out for him, theft in the first, grand jury. John’s still haunting us. I think he’s giving up, she tells me of Tyler, with a frown emoji. Then she writes, “He won’t last a day in prison. I think he’ll pull a John.

Miss Hicks: Hello?

B: Hi, Miss Hicks, this is Brian Reed, the radio reporter.

I quickly call Maya from my cell phone, hence the lower-quality recording, but her mother, Tyler’s grandmother, Miss Irene Hicks, picks up and says Maya’s not feeling up to talking. So instead, Miss Hicks explains to me what’s happening with Tyler.

Miss Hicks: They got nine felony charges against him right now.

B: Nine felony charges?

Miss Hicks: Yes. He’s saying, Cordelia cook me some supper cuz I might not get nothing but jail food for the next couple of months. 

Tyler’s grandmother, Miss Hicks, says she doesn’t know all the details of the charges against her grandson. They’re not publically filed yet. But Tyler’s mom, Maya, heard from a family friend who works in local law enforcement that a grand jury had indicted Tyler on a felony count for theft of the 48-foot trailer he took from John’s property, along with the buses filled with lumber and antiques. Tyler’s had misdemeanors before, but never a felony. And to exacerbate things, it turns out about a month ago, around Thanksgiving, in an incident unrelated to John, Tyler was also arrested for armed burglary. He went to pick up his youngest daughter, who lives with him, from her mother’s place and according to Tyler, her mom wouldn’t let him in, and he was concerned for his daughter’s safety so he busted down the door and pulled his daughter out, and the mom called the cops who charged him with armed burglary because he had a gun, which he says was in his car but which the mom said he had on him. Tyler has a court date tomorrow for the burglary charge, and his mother and grandmother are worried that the judge is gonna toss him in jail when he sees the new theft count for the trailer from John’s. This all couldn’t be happening at a worse time, because Tyler recently found out he has a fourth baby on the way, with his current girlfriend.

B: Oh man. What a mess. 

Miss Hicks: (laughing ruefully) Tell me about it. 

As we’re talking, Miss Hicks does this thing I’ve heard so many people do, not only in Bibb county but everywhere. Talking about what she sees as one injustice that’s happening to someone close to her, her grandson, suddenly gets her thinking about another injustice a little further removed, and then another, further removed from that, and then another, further removed from that. We’re on the phone for 45 minutes and she ends up giving me this whole litany. She’s complaining about sexual abuse by police officers, about the cop in Chicago who shot a black teenager 16 times, the atrocious candidates for president, and her quote, “sorry governor, Robert Bentley.”

Miss Hicks: Holy mackerel, it’s just a whole bunch of mess.

B: Miss Hicks, you sound like John B. McLemore.

Miss Hicks: You know what? (laughing) Well I mean right now it is very precarious.

Right now it’s very precarious, Miss Hicks says.

Miss Hicks: I tell you, the whole system is bad. 

Miss Hicks’ life has felt precarious for a long time now. Tyler’s ordeal is only the most recent trouble to wedge itself into her days. Miss Hicks still cares for her son Jimmy, Tyler’s uncle Jimmy, even though he’s 58 years old, because he’s severely incapacitated by the bullet lodged in his brain. She also supports her 45 year old daughter Maya, Tyler’s mother, who lives with Miss Hicks too and who, despite being really smart and having a college degree, finds it hard to hold a job because of depression and other health problems. There was also an extended family member living with Miss Hicks for seven years, after he got out of prison for a sex offense. He just moved out, and no sooner did his room clear than in moved a granddaughter. Meanwhile someone’s left a dog behind who’s about to have a litter of puppies, and Tyler and his kids and pregnant girlfriend are living in a half-finished house Tyler’s been building in Miss Hicks’ yard.

Miss Hicks: You find a solution for my, my my my conditions here I would appreciate it, any, any idea you have I, it’d be welcome. Kick ‘em out and shoot ‘em all, or do something. (laughs) Whoo! I don’t know whether I’m coming or going. If I had a different, uh, disposition I would probably would go stark raving crazy. I’d just take my medicine and take my Bocelli, and if you hear me play Bocelli then you know I’m sad.

Andrea Bocelli. Miss Hicks is an opera lover.

Miss Hicks: Oh yeah, I like all opera. Yeah, Bertie’s? my favorite, but

B: Bocelli’s for when you’re feeling depressed?

Miss Hicks: If they hear me play the Bocelli out here they say, uh oh, Granny’s upset about something, don’t bother her right now. (laughs)

B: Have you been playing it lately?

Miss Hicks: Oh I play it all the time.

B: So you’ve been feeling sad?

Miss Hicks: I’ve been feeling sad, well and upset about things that I can’t alter. I mean, misery loves company so Maya and I be good and sad together, and you can see tears rattling in our eyes when we hear of a sad story, I said uh oh Maya don’t start your crying, I says you’re gonna make me cry now. (laughs sadly) But when she talks about Tyler she always cries here. She says she don’t have no tears left. I’m just like that middle man you know cuz I feel sorry, I mean I love Tyler more than anything, but the idiot just won’t do right you know. (laughs) He’s doing some dumb things. I can’t make up my mind whether to scold him or love him or something.

(Donna e Mobile plays)

Whether to scold Tyler Goodson, or whether to love him. A conundrum that has driven its fair share of people, mother, grandmother, girlfriends, buddies, John, a radio reporter from New York, driven all of us at one time or another, to salve our exasperation with our own personal versions of Bocelli.

Miss Hicks: Oh, that man’s got a voice like an angel.

From Serial and This American Life, I’m Brian Reed. This is Shittown.

Unknown: Hey man, How y’all doin? (a group of people chattering)

Let’s back up. A month and a half before my Sunday night phone call with Tyler’s grandmother, before the news of the grand jury and felony charges, to Woodstock town hall. It’s four months after John died, four months into this battle, between Tyler and John’s cousins, and another of Tyler’s court hearings has just ended, this one for misdemeanor trespassing, with which he was charged after going onto John’s property and taking the trailer and buses. 

John’s cousin Rita and her husband Charley are here from Florida. A special prosecutor was called in from out of town and Tyler’s lawyer came in from Bessamer. The only person who wasn’t present for Tyler’s hearing was Tyler, because he got a temporary job at a factory in Georgia and says he didn’t want to lose a day’s work to come back to Woodstock, so he sent his lawyer in his place. Rita and Charley, John’s cousins, drove 10 hours from Florida, all to watch as the judge slapped Tyler with a new offense, failure to appear, and in the course of two and a half minutes, adjourned court. 

The last time I saw Rita was our meeting after I discovered that we were staying at the same hotel and left a note under her door, though she didn’t want to talk on tape. But now, as we’re lingering in the town hall parking lot with the sun setting, we start chatting, and she says it’s ok if I record. She seems frustrated with Tyler.

Rita: I’m upset, because um, of the whole situation with him taking advantage of an 89-year-old that can’t take care of herself.

Rita says they found just one bank account for John that he used for his mother’s expenses. It had 98 dollars in it. All the items that Tyler has taken from the McLemore property, in his eyes to keep from falling into the nefarious hands of the cousins: the buses full of lumber, the trailer, the vehicles, Rita sees as Tyler stealing from John’s mother, his legal heir, Mary Grace.

Rita: And she has no money, and um, and you know, you just see her whole life, um it just wasn’t meant to be this way, you know? It just breaks my heart that there’s people like that in the world, you know, that can take advantage of good people. And I personally think there was uh, something more than this. Um…

B: What do you mean?

Rita: I don’t think John would have ever taken his life uh, and left his mother in the shape that he did. Yes, he probably would have ended up killing himself, but I think it came prematurely. 

Evidently this is how dark this feud has become.

Rita: I think he drank cyanide, but I think he was forced to drink cyanide. I think he was probably intoxicated, and someone just cheered him on, and it was something he wanted to do eventually anyway and he just did it prematurely.

B: I mean, someone, do you think it was Tyler?

Rita: Um hum. I do. I’ve told the police, I think they uh, dropped the ball on this one. I really do. I think John and Tyler had an argument. I think he probably got fed up with John and –  

Charley: You’re speculating. Just, just don’t do that –

Rita: I know, I am speculating and I’ve told him I’m speculating. 

Charley, Rita’s husband is hanging around, not exactly thrilled that Rita’s talking to me. And he’s right, Rita is absolutely speculating. There’s just no evidence at all to back this suspicion up. There’s nothing noted in the police incident report for John’s suicide, John was texting Tyler minutes before he downed the cyanide, and Faye Gambell was on the phone with John as he did it and reported nothing about hearing another person in the background, egging him on, or anything like it. She says all she heard were dogs. Rita acknowledges this, that there’s no evidence whatsoever. Still, she says, 

Rita: I just still believe it.

B: You do?

Rita: Yeah, I certainly do.

Tyler’s a thief, Rita tells me, whose trespassed repeatedly onto the property of a dead man and his infirm mother, ransacked it looking for gold, and taken valuable things that weren’t his. Why wouldn’t he be capable of offing John?

Rita: We’ll never know, but nobody will change my mind about it. 

At one point, Charley starts making a ‘cut it’ gesture across his neck.

B: Charles wants you to stop (laughs)

Charley: Come on, let’s go.

But somehow they don’t go, and before we know it we’ve been taking for more than an hour. Rita tells me all the ways she’s tried to track John’s gold. She’s called the mint, the US treasury, but she’s had no success. She also pulls out a baby book that Mary Grace kept for John, and shows it to me. It has family pictures and class photos, and report cards, and John’s birth certificate. She offers to make me copies of it. I ask how Mary Grace is doing.

Rita: Oh my gosh, she just got back from uh, Gatlinburg. 

B: What was there?

Rita: She went just up to see the leaves change.

And that’s a surprise to me, because when I met Mary Grace while she was living with John I did not get the impression that she was healthy enough to travel. But now Charley and Rita have her staying with family friends, and they say, except for the moments she gets emotional about John, she’s doing quite well. She has a TV to help her pass the time, which she didn’t have living with John. Charley says she’s gotten sharper, and become more aware of current events. She used to be a librarian and cared about that kind of stuff. Her caregivers bring her out to eat a lot. She’s gained 18 pounds in the last three months. 

Charley: She went to the river, she went and they carried her on a boat ride to the river here not long ago.

B: Really?

Charley: Yeah.

Rita: She does fine in the boat.

Charley: So she’s really doing good.

Hearing about all this, it occurs to me for kind of the first time that John probably wasn’t providing the best life for Mary Grace. I don’t like to judge the way people live, and so I hadn’t the few days I was there with Mary Grace and John, but Rita says before John died Mary Grace probably hadn’t been on a trip in 30 years. She didn’t have new clothes, there were fleas all over the house when they got in there. The windows in Mary Grace’s bedroom, John had boarded up. Rita says he’d told her he’d had trouble keeping Mary Grace in the house. Rita says Mary Grace’s nurses told her living in a dark room like that can cause a dementia patient to lose track of time. In Mary Grace’s case Rita believes she lost 10 years because she knew when her birthday was, but said she was 78 turning 79, instead of 88 turning 89, which is the age she actually was. 

Rita and Charley have lived in Florida for 30 years, but they both grew up here in Woodstock, they still own property here. And they’ve kept in touch with John and Mary Grace over the years and visited with them on trips back to Alabama. So Rita says she feels embarrassed and mad at herself that she didn’t put together what was going on and intervene sooner. I’m glad to hear Mary Grace is doing better, I tell her. By now the sun has set. Rita and Charley and I are standing in a dark, empty parking lot. This whole time the door to their SUV has been open right next to us, and I kept feeling like they could get in and speed away from me at any minute. And now, finally, they do.

Rita: OK.

Charley: Have a good night, enjoy your stay.

B: Enjoy your stay. 

Two months later I get an email. “Hey Brian, I know you are a busy, busy man, so when you have time please call me. Thanks, Rita.” Sitting at my kitchen table I call.

B: OK, I think we’re recording now.

Rita’s says it’s OK for me to tape on my cell phone. She’s at home in Florida. Charley’s out of town, which makes for an opportune time to call me, because she knows he might not approve. Rita tells me, there’s something she wants to ask me about.

B: So, what’s up?

Rita: OK. I am trying to get some information. Obviously, you know more about what is going on with the Woodstock police and Bibb county, blah blah blah. You don’t have to tell me what you know, but I’m not really sure who I can trust and who I cannot trust. And…

Rita goes on for a bit, and I can’t figure out what she’s trying to ask me. She’s talking about the Woodstock police officers. There are four of them full-time, and how she suspects that they’re working against her. John was skeptical of the cops too, she says.

Rita: You know he called, excuse the expression, but he called Woodstock a Shittown. He hated it you know.

B: Oh, I’m well aware of that.

Isn’t that what John first got in touch with me about to investigate, she says, corruption in the local police?

Rita: Was John telling you not trust the Woodstock, that Woodstock police could not be trusted? Was there one certain guy?

I tell her, John called me down here to investigate a murder that, in the end, never actually happened. Yes, he hated the police and town government, but in a completely unbiased and all-encompassing way. He wasn’t ratting on one specific person. It’s still confusing to me why exactly Rita’s asking about this until she tells me this next part, about Tyler. She’s discovered something she believes he’s done, something more serious than taking the trailer or buses, and this time she has actual evidence. 

Rita knew that after John’s suicide one of the things Tyler had taken was John’s pickup truck, so one day she called the state motor vehicle office to order a copy of the title, and when she told them the circumstances, that John B. McLemore was deceased, the woman on the phone was surprised. John B. McLemore died in June? That was strange, because someone signed his name on the truck’s title in July and sold it. Oh, Ok, Rita said. She got the name of the guy who bought the truck and tracked him down, not far from the Mississippi state line.

B: What did the guy say? Did he, did he get it directly from Tyler? He bought it directly from Tyler?

Rita: He got it directly from Tyler, and Tyler had posted it on Facebook, and he went over to Tyler’s house and met Tyler and paid $3300 for the truck. And Tyler told him that he had bought the truck from his stepdad, John McLemore. 

Meanwhile Tyler told me once that the truck was John’s. The state revoked the title. Rita got the guy to write out what happened in a statement, and he gave her the truck, saying he’d eat the 3300 bucks he’d paid for it if it meant avoiding trouble with the law. Rita also just discovered that Tyler allegedly pulled off the same shebang with John’s Mercedes. That he sold for $900.

Rita: And I do not want anyone to know this, because I just don’t know what they’re feeding Tyler.

Which brings us to why Rita was plumbing me for intel on the Woodstock police. She doesn’t want to tell them about her investigation because she believes they’re protecting Tyler. She says she asked the cops to look into these vehicles months ago, but that they came back and told her that everything was fine, that they belonged to Tyler. And there’ve been other issues she’s reported since John died, where Rita feels they’ve chosen not to investigate or arrest Tyler. Take the saga that started one day, back during the summer, when Rita and Charley were home in Florida and sent their niece, who lives in Woodstock, to check on the McLemore property. Rita says her niece arrived and saw that John’s workshop had been broken into, so she called the cops.

Rita: Well she got Leitze.

That’s officer Jerry Leitze, a veteran Woodstock cop in his 60s.

Rita: And Leitze says, “Where is Mary Grace? The homeowner should be calling.”

Jerry Leitze was familiar with the situation. He had to have known that Mary Grace would not be handling something like this. “Where is Rita?” he asked. “In Florida,” Rita’s niece told him.

Rita: And he told her we don’t have time to come over there. I’m not gonna file a report. And then the very next day is when Tyler took the buses.

A friend of Rita’s in town called her when that happened to say she’d just seen Tyler riding in front of a giant tow truck with one of John’s buses, so Rita and Charley quickly packed and booked it, first thing in the morning, to Bibb county. They went to Tyler’s grandmother Miss Hicks’ house and drove slowly by, snapping photos of the buses and the large trailer Tyler had also taken from John’s, which were all sitting in plain view in the yard. Soon after, Rita says, the person who was watching their house back in Florida picked up the phone there and someone who identified himself as Tyler, said…

Rita: If you don’t quit driving by my house and harassing me I am going to fill your ass with buckshot.

Rita wasn’t intimidated by this threat. Let me say this, she told me. We carry a gun when we’re in Woodstock. But she was pissed. She went in person to the Woodstock police station to report it, and who should be there but Jerry Leitze.

Rita: And when I walk in Jerry just hits me with, with all barrels, saying “You have got to quit riding by Tyler’s house! You have got to quit harassing him or I’m gonna have to, uh, arrest you.” And I’m like, “You gotta be kidding me! You mean to tell me I can’t drive down a public road but he can go over at Mary Grace’s and steal all of her stuff?” Which, I really didn’t say stuff, because I was mad. And then, you know, he’s like, “Lady, you gotta back off!” And I thought, wow, I think he’s on Tyler’s side.

Rita: I don’t know. I swear, I just, I don’t trust Leitze. And I’ll tell him that to his face. I’m not talking behind his back. 

I tried asking Officer Leitze about all this to his face. After a few phone calls I approached him one morning in the Woodstock town hall parking lot, but he declined to speak to me. The Woodstock police chief, Lynn Price, didn’t respond directly to Rita’s claims that the department’s been on Tyler’s side, but he told me that he and his officers made clear to Tyler that he could not take anything from the house until matters were settled in probate court. He also told me that the cops found no money or gold in John’s house, and he made a point of mentioning that the town had to pay for the cleanup of the suicide scene. All that said, I do have some insight into what’s going on with Tyler and Jerry Leitze.

Tyler: Hell, he comes over here pretty often. 

Jerry’s a family friend. Tyler says he’s especially close with his sister and her husband, and Tyler’s mom, who’s told me herself that Jerry’s a pal. Not long after Rita vented her worries to me about Letize covering for Tyler, Tyler tells me that Leitze swung by his grandmother’s recently. Tyler’s been constructing his house there, out of the old lumber that was in the buses he took. I’ve been observing Tyler’s progress on the house myself every time I visit, and it is truly remarkable.

As the heart of the house he’s used the white trailer from John’s place, outfitting it with a kitchen, and then assembled this giant, fascinating, two story structure all around it, kind of like a non-treehouse version of the Swiss Family Robinson, making use of the bus lumber but also all sorts of other material he’s scavenged: bits of driftwood, wisteria vines, telephone poles he was able to buy off a guy, an old deck he took apart, pieces of fence, a horse’s watering trough he’s turning into a shower. There’s a huge workshop with a pool table, and bedrooms for all his girls, and a second-floor porch that looks out over a pond in the forest. I come from a family of home builders and I’ve never seen anything like it.

Anyway, Officer Leitze came by not long ago and Tyler gave him a tour.

Tyler: He walked in the house, and even walked around and looked at the back side of the addition there and everything.

B: So you gave him a tour of the house that you’re building with the stuff that’s disputed that his office technically arrested you for and is going through the courts?

Tyler: Yep. I told him, I said yeah, it’s gonna be nice if I can ever get done with it. And if I stay outta prison. And he said, yeah, you better hope they don’t want this damn thing back, talking about the trailer. I said this thing ain’t going nowhere, Jerry. He said, oh, this ain’t the same one, is it? I said no. He said Oh, OK. (laughs) And then we just carried on the, another conversation.

Tyler says it was like Jerry was winking at him, being his buddy. Tyler’s mom told me Jerry stressed over Tyler’s legal issues, given that he’s their friend, and that he’s quote, “eagerly waiting for his retirement date next year.” Tyler says Jerry’s told him he’s tired of having to choose between his friends and his job. 

There’s more, right after this.

## Part 2

B: Can I tell you what Tyler’s view of you guys is? Would you mind if I told you that? Can I just, I’m curious to hear what you say.

Rita: Oh, no!

On the phone with Rita I realize there’s this whole version of her that I’ve gotten from Tyler that casts her and Charley as heartless, money-grubbing carpetbaggers, swooping in conveniently after John’s death to wrest control of the property and assets from Tyler, without a thought for Mary Grace. But then there’s the other version of Rita and Charley that I’m getting from them. Of high school sweethearts who’ve been married 41 years, who seem to have a nice relationship, who make each other laugh and don’t appear to get on each other’s nerves, even after a 10-hour drive from Florida to Woodstock. Almost every time I’ve seen Rita and Charley, at probate court, at our Best Western hotel meeting, at John’s funeral, Charley has been wearing some kind of Hawaiian shirt as if he’s trying to will these unpleasant settings into the fun-filled retirement he’d imagined. They stopped working about seven years ago, and they tell me they’ve been trying to enjoy it, except for the fact that for months now they’ve been having to drive back and forth between Charley’s father, who recently had surgery and moved in with them in Florida, and this whole mess in Bibb county, John’s suicide, and Mary Grace needing care, and no money to be found, and this never-ending fight with Tyler on top of it all.

I know that for Tyler whenever I bought up the possibility that this could all be a misunderstanding that snowballed, that both sides could have meant well, and maybe if they just hashed it out bygones could become bygones, what he always returns to, what he can’t seem to get over, was that very first interaction he had with Rita and Charley, in John’s driveway. Over the months he has repeated that story to me, how Rita and Charley passed the hospital where Mary Grace had been admitted after John’s suicide, to go straight to John’s house, trying to get in. How Tyler called Mary Grace on his way to meet him there with the keys, and she instructed him not to let them in the house. The whole thing rubbed him the wrong way.

B: He didn’t like the fact that you went to the house before the hospital.

Rita: Yeah, and he said that to me that day. He said, I can’t believe – well first of all he was like, “Well Mama this,” and I’m like, who in the heck’s Mama? I didn’t even know who he was talking about.

Mama, you might remember, is what Tyler called John’s mother, Mary Grace. Rita says the only reason they went to the house first was to pick up some essentials for Mary Grace, clean clothes and her purse, and she says actually they didn’t pass the hospital to get there because they came through Montgomery, not Birmingham, like Tyler assumed. When they arrived in Woodstock the police chief escorted them to John’s house, but they found that the door had been padlocked. The chief told them Tyler Goodson had probably put it there, and that was the first time Rita had heard his name. 

Tyler’s told me some stories about Rita and Charley, especially about that first day when they met in John’s driveway. He told me it escalated into an all-out fight really quickly, which, I wasn’t sure how fully to believe. It was hard to picture these harmless seeming retirees getting in a row like that, especially in front of the police chief. Tyler says Rita and Charley were screaming at him in the driveway, telling him off. Rita says,

Rita: Absolutely!

According to Tyler, Charley cussed at him. According to Rita,

Rita: Charley says I don’t really give a F what you think.

As she goes through her side of the story, it’s like nearly every little thing that Tyler said happened, Rita confirms, only the opposite, if that makes sense. Like she’s the lost roll of negatives to Tyler’s developed photographs.

Rita: And then when we got into the hospital, we got to the hospital he had basically turned Mary Grace against me.

What happened after the driveway quarrel, if you recall, is that Tyler refused to unlock the house for Rita and Charley, and they all went to the hospital to see Mary Grace.

Rita: You know we get to the hospital and he’s sitting just about as close as you can get to Mary Grace without being in her lap and I walk in the door and I say, “Mary Grace, I am just so sorry,” and she says, “You never had kids! You’ve never lost any kids! You don’t know how I feel!” I said, “Mary Grace do you know who this is?” She says, “Yeah, I know who you are Rita.” So I went out to the nurse’s station and asked them what was going on? They said, “She’s upset because he told her you were taking her to Florida.” 

Which wasn’t the case. They barely even knew what was going on, Rita says. There were no plans yet.

Rita: And the nurses were saying, “Who is this guy? What connection is he to her? Is he her adopted son?” He told him he was her adopted son! And so I go back in there and you know I said, “Mary Grace, now I’m here to see if, is there anything that I can do to you know, help you or whatever.” And Tyler is like, “Well I’m gonna get, you know, I’m gonna get Mama home and, oh me and Mama sit out on the porch and we talk about old times, and Mama I’m gonna get you some new shoes, and Mama my kids are gonna pick you fresh flowers every day, and…” I walked out and I told Charley, I said, “Charley, if I hear him call her Mama one more time I’m gonna go ballistic.”

B: Before you move on, can I tell you, the way you’re describing Tyler, at the hospital as putting on a show for you guys, that’s how he describes you at the hospital, as putting on a show, (Rita laughs) saying that you guys were crying over Mary Grace, and were like all boo hoo hoo or so…

Rita: No! No! I went in and I did say Mary Grace I am so sorry, I’m not saying I wasn’t crying, I probably did cry, I mean my god, I knew John Brooks. It wasn’t like he was a stranger. He’s family. But I wasn’t (theatrically) “Oh Mary Grace! I’m so sorry!” You know.

At that point, Rita says she really wasn’t sure what to make of the situation. Mary Grace was saying that she wanted to go back to her house and her dogs and have Tyler take care of her. Rita hadn’t seen Mary Grace for a while, and says she didn’t yet realize the extent of her dementia. So after a while Rita turned to Tyler…

Rita: I just told him, I said look, if Mary Grace wants you to move in and take care of her, and you wanna do that, so power be it! I’m going home. I will stay after the funeral and then I’m going home to Florida. I don’t need this. Good luck to you.

B: Wait were you actually willing to let Mary Grace go with Tyler?

Rita: Yes!

B: Like was that, were you just really calling his bluff, or was like…

Rita: No! No, I was serious. She said it was ok, she liked him, he liked her, I’m like, fine. And then the social worker called me at my motel and said, “We’re not turning Mary Grace over to him.”

Part of the reason was that Tyler isn’t kin to Mary Grace, but Rita says in addition to that the hospital staff had doubts about what Tyler was claiming. 

Rita: He sat over there and said, “Well I been taking care of Mary Grace for years. I take her to the doctor, I do this, and I do that.” Well what’s the doctor’s name? “Uh uh uh uh, I don’t know.” Who’s the healthcare? “Well uh uh uh uh, I don’t know.” Well does she take any medications? “No, she don’t take anything but vitamins.” Well they knew that was a lie, cuz they had her medical records. So he just dug hisself a ditch.

## Part 3

That, Allen says, was the beginning of his and John’s friendship. They emailed often, talked every few days. About once a month Allen would go visit and they’d troubleshoot a clock together, wander around John’s yard, get lunch at the local grocery store. Allen tried to get John to come to his neck of the woods. He wanted to take him out boating on the lake, but John never came. He said he couldn’t leave his mom for that long. Allen told me something I hadn’t known about John: John had an impressive reputation for working on world-class, high-end timepieces. Some of the finest clocks in the world.

Allen: You know he was just an absolute genius, I mean, if you uh, wanted to know something or had a problem with clocks you needed to go see John McLemore. 

B: Really? That’s like, that was known throughout…

Allen: That was actually known, probably, I know on the eastern seaboard. He would have people coming down from, uh, Massachusetts driving their car to Woodstock, Alabama to get their uh, bracket clocks fixed and stuff like that. 

B: Because he was the closest and best they could find?

Allen: Well not the, I wouldn’t say the closest, probably the best. 

In his earlier years, John used to travel to England where he visited with fellow horologists. He wrote about horology, consulted on horology books. And he was known for doing elements of restoration that very few people still do. Such as an ancient process for making things gold known as fire gilding, that is very dangerous and illegal in some places because it requires burning mercury. And another thing Allen tells me that I wanted to find out, John made good money.

Allen: John probably in the 90s could have sat on his butt and worked 2 or 3 days a week and made $150,000 a year. Easy. There’s no telling how much money he made in the clock trade. And John just probably packed that money away.

B: I mean who knows, but that sounds to me like the kind of money that could potentially amass to a bountiful hidden treasure. 

There comes a point in our conversation when Allen has a question for me.

Allen: But uh, as far as John’s… you said you found out through Tyler?

B: Uh, his sister-in-law.

Allen: His sister-in-law?

B: Yeah.

That is, as far as John’s suicide, though Allen doesn’t speak the word.

Allen: I guess that was, how long, how long ago?

B: I was able to, I went to the funeral. I was able to go to the funeral. It was right before – 

Allen: You was? Well you’re better off than I was. I didn’t find out, till a uh, nearly a week and a half later, you know, I didn’t really have a chance to, you know, say goodbye to him.

B: I’m sorry.

Allen: Yeah.

Allen had been out of town for a watch and clock convention shortly before John died, and hadn’t talked to him for a while. When he got back he and John emailed a bit. The day John would go on to kill himself Allen wrote him, telling him he wanted to come visit that week. That night, while Allen was teaching vacation bible school, he saw a call come in from John. He silenced it, and then called him back when he got home. No answer. Called him the next day. No answer. As the week went on it was the same. Allen got in touch with a mutual friend of his and John’s, a mechanic in Birmingham, whose also on John’s contact list, and asked him if he’d heard from John. He hadn’t. Allen wanted to drive to John’s place to check on him, but his wife was pregnant and sick. He decided to give it one more day, and if neither he nor the other friend heard from John, he was gonna call the Bibb county sheriff’s department. He knew John hated cops and authority, and might not forgive him for it. But he also knew John had talked about suicide, so he was ready to risk it.

Allen: You know sometimes I had to weigh that out in my head, was it worth it losing him as a friend just to, uh to uh see him get help. And I tried to get John help. I tried, I was like John, you know, let me carry you to a doctor or something. Let’s get you on some medicine or something, you know. I said we’re not going to no psychiatrist or noting like that, we can just see a regular practice doctor and see if we can’t get you on some kind of antidepressant, some kind of mood stabilizer, and he was like oh no, I ain’t taking no medicine, I’m not doing this, I’m not doing that. Even went to the bookstore and got a herbal book, uh, of more holistic, you know healing stuff that would help with depression and mood swings, and uh, carried that to him said why don’t you read this right here see if you can get something out of this? I said you probably have this in your yard. And I thought he would take on that since you know he liked horticulture maybe he could –

B: That’s a good idea.

Allen: Could help or heal himself holistically. And uh, that book just sit there. It’s probably sitting there to this day in his shop. 

B: Wow, I had no sense talking to him that he had people in his life, like you, who were trying to help him this way.

Allen: I don’t think John realized how many people cared for him. And I just think that’s really sad because I actually think he died thinking he was lonely.

Though I’m not sure there’s much of a difference between being lonely, and thinking you are. Allen never got to the point of asking the sheriff to check on John, because the night before he was planning to do that he was driving home from church with his family and got a call from Faye Gambell, the town clerk who John had called as he drank cyanide, and to whom he’d given his final instructions and contact list. Allen says as soon as she told him she was with Woodstock town hall, he knew. He immediately pulled over to the side of the road. He was devastated. His whole body was shaking. But then Faye told him when John had actually died. And to the sorrow were added some other emotions.

Allen: When I found out when it had happened, you know, I was kind of irate. I didn’t find out until after John had done been buried.
 
John had been in the ground for more than a week and Faye was just now calling him. Allen says he pressed Faye on it, asked her why she was notifying him after the funeral. And he says she acted kind of weird about it.

Allen: She tried to say that she, uh, tried to call me but I looked back through my phone there was no call, no message or anything. I’ve got nothing. I mean that just seems like a pretty weak excuse, somebody call and say you well, I tried you and I couldn’t get you on the phone and not leave a message or anything like that.

And it’s not like she had to dig up his information or something. John sent it to her.

Allen: I mean I’m what, like fourth on the list right there. This would be like, this is who you need to call and contact. I mean, I’m just, I find that kind of uh, that kind of disturbed me.

It disturbed Allen not only because it caused him to miss his friend’s funeral, but because it’s pushing his mind to some unpleasant places. The day before I met with Allen he actually spoke with Tyler for a while and got the whole low down on the cousins. Rita, the cousin, is listed halfway down on John’s contact list. Allen finds it questionable that Faye or someone else managed to reach her yet he and these other names are all at the top of the sheet, and somehow he was skipped over. 

Allen: I’d be very interested to know, you know, the other people, when were they actually called? Was it just me, was it, uh, the top people on his contact list? Cuz I think they knew that these people knew John best. And I think they probably actually tried to keep us away from the situation for some reason or something. 

B: (surprised tone) Really?

Allen: Yeah. I mean, from talking with Tyler, the way stuff’s uh, played out in this, uh, it’s uh, it’s a little fishy.

Allen continues in this mode, tiptoeing toward something.

Allen: I’m just trying to figure, you know, what would it benefit a person not to try to contact a person? I don’t know if they just wanted, they didn’t want people down there until the situation was under control the way they wanted it to be. Maybe it’s somebody trying to uh take control of something. Cuz they would know that John’s close close friends would know what I’m talking about.

B: I can tell Allen is being purposefully vague here. I think maybe he’s not sure what I know already, or else maybe he knows I know? So he knows he doesn’t have to say it out loud? But I’m not actually sure I do know what he’s talking about, though maybe I do know. Anyway, he is now making weird eyes at me.

B: Yeah. You’re looking at me in like a coded way. Um.

Allen: You know I can tell you my theory about something but I’m not gonna do it on the air.

B: Do you think I should call the other people on the list?

Allen: I think it would be a good idea, I mean, to further investigate. And just for the simple fact that they, they could possibly not even know. I mean, you’d be doing John a favor, cuz surely he would want them people to know or they wouldn’t be on the list. 

(phone ringing)

## Part 4

(phone ringing) 

Bill: Hello?

B: Hi, is this Bill Meyer?

Bill: Yes.

B: Hi, um Bill, were you a friend of John McLemore’s?

Bill: Yeah?

B: Um, I’m calling with some sad news that maybe you’re aware of, but he passed away earlier this summer.

Bill: Who did?

B: John B. McLemore, yeah.

Bill: Oh, I didn’t know that! I’ve been uh, writing emails to him and he hasn’t uh responded. And I called him I think… oh, what’d he die from?

B: Uh, he actually committed suicide I’m sorry to say.

Bill: Oh for god’s sake. What happened to his mother?

Bill Meyer, number 7 on John’s list. Clearly he wasn’t called. Bill was a friend and clock customer of John’s for decades. He lives in Utah, in a house he describes as being more like a museum than a house. He’d drive from Utah to Alabama sometimes to visit John.

Bill: John seems to have made a insurmountable challenge out of living. It’s so sad to hear that he finally did it. It just, uh, it just makes me so incredibly sad.

Machine voice: Hello. You have reached micros and the escapement maker.

This is the answering machine of a horologist friend of John’s, in a small town in the pacific northwest, who asked that I not use his name because he’s very private. He picked up as I was leaving a message. He says Faye did tell him John had died, but only after the funeral.

Horologist Friend: John meant a hell of a lot to me. He meant a hell of a lot to me. 

And then another Brit from the list, Duncan Grieg. 

Duncan: At the moment, I’ve in front of me got a whole load of letters and photographs that John’s sent me over the years.

A respected clock restorer from Tonbridge, England, who never met John in person but over more than a decade spent many late-night hours developing a friendship with him on the phone and via letters. I was the one who informed Duncan of John’s death.

Duncan: Yeah as you can probably tell I’m very sad about it. I think he should have gone on to been a curmudgeonly old gentleman that survived the ravages of time. 

Tom: The enigma that John McLemore was.

And Tom Moore, John’s chemistry professor in college, now a university chancellor who went on to become a lifelong friend.

Tom: One of the most incredi – I’m gonna start crying. I can’t help it (crying a bit).

B: It’s OK.

Tom: (teary voice) One of the most incredible people I’ve ever known.

Like with others, Tom says the town clerk, Faye, did call him about John’s suicide, but only after he’d been buried. After talking to the seven people at the top of John’s list, I learn that none of them were at John’s funeral because none of them were contacted in time, and some not at all. 

It was interesting. Most of these men didn’t know each other beyond maybe having interacted once or twice in horological circles over the years. The men talked to me for hours, without batting an eye, even if I’d just called them cold and informed them that their friend had committed suicide. Which, at first I thought was pretty remarkable. But then it occurred to me that they were all friends of John B. McLemore’s. Which means you are predisposed to having long, rambling conversations on the phone. Of these friends, the one who knew John the longest, since he was a teenager, was Tom Moore, John’s college professor. John showed up in Tom’s general chemistry course as a freshman at Birmingham Southern College in the early 80s.

Tom: Walk in to a class of 85 to 95 students and look around, and boy, what’s that kid doing here?

Birmingham Southern is a small, private, liberal arts college that’s been around since the 1800s. Tom says at the time when John was there the student body was made up largely of children of professionals: doctors and lawyers. They were preppy. John was not.

Tom: Bushy red hair, unkempt, clothing from a different socioeconomic background. He was clearly different.

Tom says John didn’t make any friends at Birmingham Southern, and he didn’t live there. Every night he drove back to his parents’ house. Back to his childhood bedroom. Back to Bibb county. And Tom could tell that as much as John didn’t fit in at college, he didn’t fit in back home either. Tom got the sense that John had been picked on a lot over the years, growing up.

Tom: He would do things, uh, as a college student to bring ridicule on himself. I want to say he would wear a red wig, or a green wig to class. 

Sure enough, Tom says, the other kids would laugh at him. And that was the point.

Tom: I took it to be out of, this history that, I’m gonna be made fun of. And I can’t stand being made fun of just by being who I am. So I’ll do some things that enable me to understand why people are making fun of me, and it’s not just me being me. It’s pretty tragic. I saw that in him, and that’s part of why I reached out to him.

John B. McLemore’s education is the source of some gossip in Woodstock. I have heard that he held multiple degrees: in chemistry, in biology. I have heard that he quit school because he was smarter than the professors. I have heard that he had to leave after blowing up a laboratory. The reality was less dramatic.

Tom: He was bad at school.

John was a college dropout. He left Birmingham Southern after three years. According to Tom, if John was studying a topic he was interested in, he would learn it exhaustively. Tom spent many afternoons watching John scribble on the blackboard in his office, obscure calculations and theories that were beyond even Tom’s comprehension. But when it came to stuff the professors wanted him to focus on, John was almost allergic to it. Tom thinks John got a D or maybe a C in his chemistry class. But John spent hours in the lab on his own, outside of class, figuring out techniques he could use in his clock restorations. Tom risked getting in trouble and let John access the lab when he wanted. Remember this?

(sound of pouring)

J: (whispering) There you go, there you go,

When John gold-plated a dime for me in his workshop one afternoon?

J: I may be dead and gone one day but you’ll have a souvenir from Shittown, Alabama.

Tyler: A golden penny.

J: A gold dime! 

Tyler: Oh!

J: A motherfuckin gold-plated dime! Shit. 

I do still have the dime, by the way. That electroplating process, John worked it out as a student at Birmingham Southern as a way to gild clock pieces that doesn’t require burning dangerous amounts of mercury. It uses potassium cyanide instead.

Sometimes in college when John came into Tom’s office in the afternoon for one of their blackboard sessions, Tom says John would seem depressed, to the point where Tom thought, he might be trying to say goodbye for good. Tom says he recommended John to a school counselor, and John saw her for a bit, even went on medication, but according to Tom, John didn’t like the way the medicine altered his personality. And he chose not to seek any more treatment. 

Tom figured out that if he asked John to tell him about a clock he was working on, or some other topic he was studying, he could get John excited and redirect his attitude so that by the end of the session he would seem lifted out of his despair. Though this could take hours. Tom says he can vividly remember sitting in his office with John on a fall day, glancing at the sun while it set outside his window, watching the sky turn colors over campus as he thought about his wife waiting for him at home, but looking back at John and thinking,

Tom: That I’m not sure John’s ready to go yet. 

Then listening to John go on, as outside the sky turned dark.

## Part 5

John had a phrase for the M.O. Tyler would often employ when faced with an affront. Quote, “The whoop ass now solution.” John cared for Tyler, but he was also perpetually frustrated by him, and was fixated on the possibility that if Tyler didn’t get his life in order soon he could end up becoming an irredeemable fuck up. When Tyler did something John didn’t approve of, like party too much at the tattoo parlor, or get in a nasty screaming match with one of his exes, or get locked up in jail and ask John to bail him out, it would annoy John.

J: I told Tyler I’ve never seen the inside of a jail in my life until I met you. Keep your ass…

And I would hear about it.

J: See that’s what he can’t do. He can’t keep his fuckin ass outta trouble. Am I expecting too much? You know he was raised by a fuckin child molester. Maybe I’m expecting too much. 

And just like with Tyler’s grandmother, talking about Tyler’s tribulations could quickly get John riled up about tribulations the world over. Which I know we’ve all heard John deliver this kind of harangue before, but I share this only so you can see how riled up Tyler could make John. He really inspired some of John’s most virtuosic work. Here, I’ll save you all the windup about Tyler, and go straight to the money.

(opera in background)

J: We ain’t nothing but a nation of goddamn chickenshit, horse shit, tattle-tale, pissy ass, whiny, fat, flabby, outta shape, Facebook-lookin, damn twerk fest, peekin out the windows and slippin around, listening in on the cell phones and spying in the peep hole, and peepin in the crack under the goddamn door, listenin in the fuckin sheetrock. You know, Mr. Putin please, show some fuckin mercy! I mean, come on, drop a fuckin bomb, won’t you? (opera crescendos, ends) (Sighs) I gotta have me some tea. 


Still, John really stuck with Tyler, despite the irritations. He gave him more and more work, helped him out with more and more money, kept track of his court appointments on a calendar. Hired him a lawyer, accompanied him to court. Gave him lectures and advice. Though it could sometimes feel to John like a one-way street. On the phone one time I asked John a lame question about him and Tyler, but the way he responded stayed with me. 

B: Do you think your guys’ relationship is more of a friendship, or more of a paternal relationship?

J: What you wanted to say but you didn’t come out and say it, is, is your guys’ relationship more of a friendship or more of a usership? (laughs) Ha, that’s what you wanted to say!

B: No, it actually wasn’t what I wanted to say, it’s what you wanted to say apparently. 

J: (laughing continues)

B: Why do you say that?

J: You do say that when you’re pissed off at two in the damn morning, and you know he’s all sort of damn drunk. See this isn’t the first time I’ve pulled this stunt. I could keep you on this phone for hours with another case by the name of Michael Fuller. 

John brings up this name, Michael Fuller, in the last conversation he and I ever have, a little more than a week before he killed himself. He doesn’t reveal a ton about him, just that Michael was a 20-something guy John had also kind of taken under his wing years ago when he was much younger himself. Unlike Tyler, John says Michael came from a family of professionals, a quote, “good family,” but was rebellious, didn’t hang with the best of influences.

J: You know he was gonna be out with that wild crowd partying, hanging out at Senor Frog’s and the Quest, and all these damn discos, and doing all this damn dope, and he just made a career out of going to jail. He would be… he would be about 45 now. And the last time I heard from him he was living up there in your neck of the woods paying some, you know like $1800 a month to live in some scruffy apartment that didn’t even have a damn bathroom, and he was shacked up with some damned old Argentinian girl that was bringing up high powered pot. So yeah, I’ve seen this shit before. 

John felt like he’d failed with Michael, and he worried he was about to fail with Tyler too.

J: Doesn’t seem like a very good track record for me, is it?

---

## Part 6

It’s not long before I realize, follow any finger that is being pointed in the aftermath of John’s suicide and there will be another set of fingers on the other end, not only pointing right back, but in a bunch of other directions too. Everyone is pointing at everyone. One afternoon at my Best Western along the highway I’m walking to the elevator to go to my room when who should pop out of the stairwell but John’s cousin, Rita. By the time it registers in my brain that it’s her, we’ve already moved past each other and it’s too late and awkward to turn back and say something. This is weeks after I’d met Rita at probate court and she declined to do an interview, a whole separate trip. I had no idea she’d be in town, and now I’m afraid she might think I’m stalking her. So I ask the front desk which room she and her husband are in, four rooms down from mine, and write her a note which I slip under her door, explaining that I didn’t know she would be here, but since we both are, would she be open to meeting with me? And by the way, sorry for creepily leaving a note under your door.

The next afternoon we all sit around a table in the hotel common area. It’s Rita and two other women who introduce themselves as cousins of John’s, as well as Rita’s husband Charley. They don’t allow me to record. They are livid with Tyler. They are saying he’s the person who’s getting away with something, taking all sorts of stuff from John’s house that they say is not his. The buses and trailer, but much more too. They call him a con man. 

They show me Google Maps satellite images of John’s yard with the buses and trailer in them, dated from 2010. Which means that they were in his yard at least three years before the dates that are on Tyler’s bills of sale, which are dated 2013. This is proof, they say, that Tyler’s documents are bogus. And I have to say it is suspicious, though Tyler’s not the only target of their suspicion. There’s Faye Gambell, the town clerk. Rita asks me if I’ve spoken to her. I tell her yes. That’s interesting she says, kind of to herself. She says she didn’t talk to you. Rita and Charley say Faye hasn’t passed along any instructions to them from John. They’ve heard she has a list of people to contact, but she hasn’t given them that either. 

Then there’s Boozer Downs, John’s lawyer. They tell me he was supposed to take a written statement from Faye, of what John told her the night he killed himself. But it’s been more than a month now, and curiously he still hasn’t done that. And then there’s me. Charlie clearly thinks this meeting is a terrible idea. He keeps getting up from the table and pacing, speaking to me sharply, saying I just want them to get in a, quote, “pissing match with Tyler.” At one point I ask, I thought harmlessly, where Mary Grace is living now, and Rita thinks on it for a moment, and then tells me, “I’d rather not say.” 

I also ask about the text message Tyler showed me from John, which said Tyler could have anything he wanted in the house. Rita thinks Tyler fabricated it. She tells me it’s strange that it was sent from John’s computer and not a cell phone. I tell her, I don’t think it’s all that strange, and one of the other women cuts me off. “Of course you don’t.” “What do you mean by that?” I ask. “We know you’re like, friends with him,” She says.

On and on the accusations fly. It’s head-spinning. One day Tyler suggests to me that Boozer Downs, John’s attorney, might be in cahoots with the cousins, and that he might had suppressed John’s will so that they could split the assets. Meanwhile Boozer sends me an email asking if he can retract the interview he did with me because the cousins suspect him of being in cahoots with Tyler. “It got ugly in hearing,” he writes. “I am concerned that I should not have spoken to you on the recording.” Boozer says he did not hide John’s will because there was no will to hide. 

I also get an email from one of John’s friends, who I met in the restaurant. He’s certain there must have been a reason he wasn’t contacted about John’s death. He includes the words, “Maybe I knew too much.” Then I call back the first guy I met with, John’s fellow horologist Allen Bearden, and tell him I’ve done what he suggested, contacted the other friends on the top of John’s list, and indeed none of them was called in time for the funeral, and a few not at all. 

Allen: Now don’t you find that very strange, Brian?

And then Allen clarifies his theory for me. He thinks all the weirdness surrounding John’s death, the fact that he and other people on John’s list weren’t contacted, is because someone has taken John’s gold. He is not exactly sure who, but what he suspects is that there is potentially a large conspiracy taking place within the local Woodstock town government and police, to cover it up.

Allen: If the gold was there I think, you know, somebody came and got that gold, you know? I mean, and probably, probably stepped over John’s body and took care of that before they even did John. Now who did that, I don’t know. But I think it’s somebody to do, with inside that city hall. The whole thing, it’s just, it’s very suspicious. (laughs ruefully) Very very very suspicious. Somebody has that gold.
