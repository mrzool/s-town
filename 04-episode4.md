# Part 1

My first visit to Alabama. John’s bedroom. When he was still alive.

J: Go go go go, get down to climate change now, go go go…

Standing in front of John’s computer, which sits eye-level atop a large, professional-grade sound system, his prolific collections of CDs and unopened Furbys on the shelves behind us, John’s scrolling through, showing me a manifesto he’s written.

J: Go go go go…

B: How many pages is this?

B: I’ve got no fuckin idea, go go go go…

It’s 53. The document is filled with charts, graphs, images of violence, and pornography. Of Westboro Baptist Church protesters and of Lady Gaga getting vomited upon by a so-called vomit artist, as well as paragraph after paragraph, all laying out a McLemorian unified theory of economic, environmental, and societal decline. And oh, at one point as he’s showing me this material, John quickly and casually pulls up this document.

J: Oh yeah, I have this on file at all times in case it’s necessary. You never know.

B: Your suicide note?

J: We weren’t gonna call it out loud, but (laughing) you did!

B: Well we’re looking at it. It’s right here.

J: (laughing) I keep it on file, yeah, well we didn’t have a camera, big mouth. 

He doesn’t linger on the suicide note long enough for me to read it. He claims he doesn’t want to talk about it.

J: (whispering) You shouldn’t have said that. Fuck it.

But he’s the one that brought it up, and as the day goes on and he continues to tool around on his computer, moving on to other topics, he keeps mentioning it. I’m not sure why, what exactly John is trying to tell me, but after a while I tell him what I think.

B: I would like it if you wouldn’t kill yourself. 

J: (laughing) Ok, well it’s not gonna happen this afternoon! I’m in a pretty good mood today. (blows nose)

This is what it was like to talk about suicide with John. He was so cavalier about it. He’d dismiss your concern, laugh it off, and try to change the subject.

J: I found a better video that describes the entire history of the fossil fuel industry in about 17 seconds.

B: But wait a minute, I want to go back to this. Cuz you’re dumping a lot on me here. Why do you have to kill yourself? Turn away from the computer because you’re getting distracted. I want you to seriously think about this. 

J: Doesn’t everyone? OK this is not distracting, this is another reason. FDIC BOE resolving systemically…

B: You know what? Forget that. You’re, you’re changing the subject.

J: There was a very good chance of me not being alive at the time you got out here, so…

B: Why?

J: Tired in a way that I can’t put into words. Tired. Tired. 

I wasn’t the only one John showed his suicide note to, apparently.

J: I also emailed it to town hall and my lawyer over there to keep on file, and –

B: You emailed your suicide note to town hall and your lawyer?

J: Um hum. Yeah I actually, uh, mailed a uh, email to the town of uh…

He pulls it up, the email, and reads the information he sent them.

J: How many dogs I had, and the way to identify them, and the vet, a list of people to contact in case I decide to blow my damn head off, where some of the money is hiding, but not all of it.

That is, where some but not all of John’s money is hiding. He did not disclose those details to me.

J: And there’s things I won’t discuss with that thing turned on now, but I’m unbanked, and you can make as much as you want to make of that.

John did tell me that if he died that afternoon, $100,000 would go to PETA. He also said this.

J: I’ve often thought that I can continue to live and burn up my saved money or I could donate it to someone that might need it more, that’s younger, whose life is ahead of them.

B: Tyler and Jake?

J: Um hmm. I wanna leave them kids a shit pot full of money instead of me burning it up and staying alive.

From Serial and This American Life, I’m Brian Reed. This is Shittown.

Tyler: I gotta take these dogs to the vet. John’s little dog, that one right yonder, Pipsqueak, that’s Madeline…

It’s been more than two weeks since John died. And in the absence of a will, PETA was not bequeathed $100,000, and Tyler Goodson was not bequeathed a shit pot full of money. In fact there’s not even money for John’s own dogs. Tyler’s taking care of a couple of them here at the tidy trailer he’s living in with his girlfriend and two of his daughters, and he’s had to scrounge together cash to cover their vet appointment this morning. 

But the more important appointment Tyler’s preparing for today is at the Bibb county probate court, the court that handles matters involving estates of the deceased. At 10 am John’s cousins from Florida have a hearing scheduled to request permanent guardianship over John’s mother, Mary Grace, which because John didn’t have a will, would mean the cousins would get control over the property and all of Mary Grace’s and John’s belongings and assets. So Tyler is gonna go as well to petition the probate judge to intervene and try to get what’s his. He says he has a bunch of things over at John’s that belong to him, and the cousins won’t let him on the property to get them. They’ve even put a gate across John’s driveway with ‘no trespassing’ signs around it.  Tyler estimates the total value for all of his stuff, conservatively, at more than $25,000. He’s typed up a list with the description, location, and value of each item that’s very thorough.

B: You’ve got a case of black spray paint, large glass jugs…

Extension cords, a copper teapot, toys Tyler tells me John bought for his kids, even the swing set is on there. Plus there are a lot of tools, which Tyler says is a particular problem for him right now because he’s had a falling out with his partner at the tattoo parlor, so he no longer has that business, he doesn’t have John anymore to employ him, and now he can’t even drum up odd jobs, he says, because he can’t get to his tools: his lawnmower and his welder, and his masonry stuff. 

For a lot of these items Tyler doesn’t have proof of ownership. Though, for a few of the big-ticket ones he does. He shows me a couple short receipts, handwritten on notebook paper, and signed by the sellers. 

B: This is the, the bill of sale for uh…

Tyler: Sale’s for them school buses and stuff down there on the slab. Two buses and an 18-wheeler trailer.

B: Oh those are yours?

Tyler: Yeah. 

John showed me these buses when he took me around his property. One’s yellow and one’s blue. There’s also a big 18-wheeler trailer. It’s all really old, the buses don’t run anymore, but they’re chock full of wood and building materials and antique appliances. John didn’t mention that stuff was Tyler’s.

Tyler: You see, me and John had been planning on building something out there for a while now, and we’d just been accumulating old bricks and the lumber and stuff like that. I got just about everything down there to build a house with. I’m ‘bout to lose it all if something don’t get done, but hopefully this little bit of proof will help me.

The probate court sits on the town square of Centerville, the Bibb county seat, in a drab annex building across from the main courthouse. It’s not even a traditional courtroom. It’s mostly just a waiting area and reception desk, like a DMV. As people come inside they go under a sign hanging over the front entrance that says, in elaborate font, ‘Through these doors pass the most important people on earth: the citizens of Bibb county.’

When I arrive, Tyler’s sitting off to the side stoically, his tattoos peeking down his wrists. I followed him here and let him go in on his own, because I have my own reason for going to court today. I want to introduce myself to John’s cousins and ask if they’ll do an interview with me, and I don’t want them to get the wrong idea, think I’m working for Tyler or something.

The cousins are standing there, not far from Tyler, the middle-aged couple I remember from the funeral. I’ve learned that their names are Rita and Charley Lawrence. They’re huddled with two other people I don’t recognize. Rita, like Tyler, is holding some papers. She has glasses and short greying hair. I walk over to her. “Excuse me ma’am,” I say, “Are you Rita?” Yes, she says. “I’m Brian Reed, nice to meet you.” I tell her I’m sorry for her loss, that I’m very sad about what happened with John. I explain who I am, where I work, how John got in touch with our radio show, and that I started investigating some local goings on with him. She seems both surprised and confused by me which is completely understandable. Your cousin drinks cyanide and then a reporter shows up at court afterwards, saying he’d been investigating potential crimes and corruption and wrongdoing with him for more than a year. It’s not the most normal sequence of events. 

“So where do you live?” she asks. New York I tell her. “Are you serious?” she says. “You come down here from New York for this?” I ask Rita if she’ll meet with me. I want to tell her more about the story I’ve been doing with John. I want to ask her about him, his family history, and find out what’s going on with his affairs. She seems OK with it, and says sure, after the hearing we can go somewhere and talk. And then, we stand there, awkwardly, waiting for the judge to call them back to his chambers. We make small talk. Which hotel are you staying at? How long are you in town?

At that, suddenly Rita leans in very close to me and whispers, (whisper voice) “We’re leaving tomorrow.” “Why are you whispering?” I ask her. “Do you know that guy there?” she asks, still under her breath, twitching her eyes towards to Tyler who’s right behind me. “Tyler?” I say. “Yeah,” she says. Her voice gets even quieter. (whispers) “We’re leaving tomorrow, but I don’t want him to know that we’re leaving. He’s been causing nothing but trouble.”

Soon Judge Jerry Powell will summon Rita and her husband Charlie, as well as the two others they’re here with and John’s lawyer Boozer Downs, into his chambers to have a private meeting. And Tyler will go in with them to make his final plea. Despite John having said that he wanted to leave money and gold to Tyler, despite John texting Tyler minutes before he died that he could have anything in his house that he wanted, all Tyler will ask the judge for today is the stuff that he says was his to begin with, that he’s documented neatly on his list. 

Tyler does not like going to court. He feels the courts and cops and lawyers have done nothing but victimize him since he became a teenager. But here he will suck it up and make this one last effort to do things the proper way, within the system. And the system will not be sympathetic. Judge Powell will explain to Tyler that this hearing isn’t about his stuff. It’s about signing guardianship over to Rita. He’s about to do that, he’ll say, and once he does she’ll have control over the McLemore property and everything on it. Tyler will have to work things out directly with Rita or take the matter across the street to civil court. Tyler will try to protest, but Rita will sell everything before I have a chance to bring a suit, he’ll say. And Judge Powell will tell him that if someone gives you something, he advises that you take it home with you. And that will be the end of it. Dejected, Tyler will walk out of the chambers to his car, underneath a sign reminding him that he’s one of the most important people on earth.

I wait for Rita in the reception area, and as she and her husband leave I ask where she’d like to go so we can have our conversation. But now she says she can’t; they have too much to get done before they head back to Florida the next day. We chat for a bit though, and before she goes out the door she does ask me a question about John. Quote, “Did he tell you where his money was hid?” Unquote.

Tyler: They done gutted the damn place.

B: Really?

Less than a week after the cousins gain control of the McLemore property, Tyler tells me they’ve gutted the damn place. And even though he’s not supposed to, he’s been going over to the property.

Tyler: Well I snuck down there, and you know I always go down there checking on my stuff, and everything, and John’s shop’s gone, all the toolboxes and everything, they done had somebody come down there and probably bought it all, you know those different clocks that was on the walls, all of my shit, my welder and all that stuff’s gone. The place is cleaned out. 

B: When you’ve been over there have you been poking around for the, for the buried treasure? For the gold, or the cash or whatever there is?

Tyler: Well hell yes! (laughing with Brian) I need to get it before it gets scraped off. We got to find it, Brian.

Rita suspects that John had money or gold hidden somewhere, but Tyler’s all but certain of it. He says when they would make purchases around town, John used to say, “Well, gotta go dig up some more money.” And Tyler says he knows for a fact John was buying $30,000 worth of gold at a clip. John even showed him some of it once. A small box out of which John pulled a single tiny gold bar, though it was clear the box was filled with others, Tyler says. And John strongly implied that there was much more gold where that came from. 

B: So where have you looked? You mind telling me?

Tyler: I mean it could be in the graveyard, it could be in the maze, it could be anywhere but, I think it’s up there under the damn doghouse or something.

Here’s Tyler’s theory about where the hidden treasure might be. The doghouse is near the human house, and you can see it from the kitchen window where John spent a lot of time, talking on the phone, brewing highly caffeinated tea, pissing in the sink. Tyler thinks John would have stashed the treasure in a spot where he could always see it from the kitchen.

Tyler: And plus I think all them mutt dogs protected it.

B: So have you, what have you, have you poked around on that yet? The doghouse?

Tyler: Well, I’ve went out and I’ve looked in the dog’s house and seen if there was any type of compartments built up under it or whatnot, and I’ve been up under the house, and I’ve been out in flower beds and shit like that, but hell, Brian, up under John B.’s house he had me weld up these little metal doorways.

These are the gates Tyler once told me about, that he built for the dungeon-like tunnels in John’s basement.

Tyler: But I’ve done been up under there. I’ve done been all up under there and all them fuckin spider webs and rats and snakes, and I ain’t seen the first sign of anything. You know, we’ve done so many projects around there that it’s got to be somewhere in one of them projects that we’ve done, you know. Somewhere that if anybody could find it, it would be me. And you know he’s probably left me some type of clu – 

Tyler’s phone cuts out for a second, but he was saying John probably left him some type of clue.

Tyler: Yeah, I’m sure he’s left me some type of clue. And I just ain’t thinking of it.

In one of our phone conversations, John did say this to me.

J: A wise man has his money where he can sleep best at night. A wise man does not have a lot of paper money in a wood frame house. A wise man has some hard assets. See hard assets mean different things to different people. To some people it may mean silver and gold. A wise man may have some of them out in the fuckin woods. 

I didn’t mention this to Tyler, partly because I didn’t feel like it was my place to encourage treasure hunting on John’s property, but also because I have no idea if John meant this literally or was just saying stuff. Plus there are like a hundred acres of woods there anyway, something that Tyler’s very aware of.

Tyler: It is on that fuckin property, Brian. I’m thinking I’m gonna have to get a metal detector and go over the backyard.

The next time I see Tyler he tells me he has procured the metal detector and has been using it to scour John’s place every night for two weeks straight. He uses a police scanner app on his phone to keep an ear out for cops while he’s there. One of his most promising clues were these pages he found of coordinates John had written down, latitudes and longitudes for the town of Woodstock, or Shittown as it was labeled on the document, along with coordinates for K3 Lumber, the trailer park Tyler lives in, as well as, naturally, the nuclear reactor in Chernobyl.

Among those were coordinates on John’s property. One set was for John’s house. And another set, when Tyler typed them into Google, brought him to the maze, though just a little bit to the side of the maze, which seemed promising. In that spot he saw an old plastic tub, upside town on the grass. He kicked it over and waved the metal detector over the ground it had been covering. It started going off, beeping. Tyler dug, and he found a bunch of bottles, just a bunch of old glass bottles. He asked me if I’d ever seen the movie Holes, because that’s what it looks like over there after all his digging. 

The hunt continues, in a minute.
